# BeSpider
A spider solitaire clone for the [Haiku Operating System](https://www.haiku-os.org/).

## Usage
To compile, simplyâ€¦

1. Download the `.zip` version of this repository (or clone it using Git).
2. Open a Terminal window.
3. `cd` into the `BeSpider-master` folder.
4. Run `make`.
5. `cd` into the `objects.x86-gcc2-release` folder  (or something else similarly titled) that was just created.
6. Run `open BeSpider`.

## How to Play
The goal of spider solitaire is to arrange all of your cards into columns from King to Ace. Once you get a column like that, it dissapears. You win if you get all of the cards to dissapear.

You can move cards between columns by dragging them. When moving cards, you can either move one card off the top of a pile, or several cards (as long as they go in descending order).

If you click on the cards in the bottom right of the screen, a new card will be added to every pile. Then you can use those new cards to your advantage.

_Good Luck!_
